[EasyQuery](https://korzh.com/easyquery) adds a query builder, ad-hoc reporting and data filtering
to .NET applications. The samples in this repository show it on ASP.NET Core + Blazor.

## Samples

| Sample | Scenario | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| [Advanced search (Blazor Server)](AdvancedSearch.BlazorServer) | Advanced search | ASP.NET Core 6 · Blazor Server · C# |
| [Ad-hoc reporting (Blazor WebAssembly)](AdHocReporting.BlazorWasm) | Ad-hoc reporting | ASP.NET Core 6 · Blazor WebAssembly · C# |

* **Advanced search.** A full-page query builder: users pick the columns, combine any conditions they need, run the query and work with the result — sorting, paging and export.
* **Ad-hoc reporting.** A basic ad-hoc reporting tool: users keep a list of reports, set up the columns and conditions of each one, and see the result as a table (with grouping and totals) or a chart.

## Quick start

1. Get the code: [download the ZIP](https://github.com/easyquery/eq-samples-aspnetcore-blazor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip),
   or `git clone https://github.com/easyquery/eq-samples-aspnetcore-blazor.git`.
2. Open `Samples.Blazor.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 (17.2 or later).
3. Set the sample you want as the startup project and run it. Or, from the command line, `cd` into a sample folder and run `dotnet run`; each sample's README has the exact steps.

Every sample creates and fills its own demo database on the first start. That can take a minute
or two; later starts take a few seconds.

## Package versions

All NuGet package versions of this repository, EasyQuery and EasyData included, are set in one
file: [`Directory.Packages.props`](Directory.Packages.props) (NuGet central package
management, which needs Visual Studio 2022 17.2+ or the .NET 6.0.300+ SDK). To try another
EasyQuery version, change it there.

## License key

You don't need one to start. On the first run the sample shows a **No license** dialog: enter your
email, then the code we send to it, and you get a free 30-day trial key on the spot. The key is saved to `EasyQuery.lck`; restart the sample to apply it.

Already have a key? Put it into `appsettings.json` of the app that serves the EasyQuery API and the dialog won't appear:

```json
"EasyQuery": {
  "LicenseKey": "your key goes here"
}
```
